**Julius Magsino**

My goals from last week were:

  * Continue working on the designs
  * Help Shiho with the front-end coding for the website

This week we started actually working with the actual design of the Spotify application.  We had to make some adjustments to our previous UI design to fit the Spotify tab model, so I am now currently making mockups of how our end product would look like.  Once I am done, I will give them to Shiho.

We also came up with an name for the app itself: harmonii.us.  I created a logo for the app, but ran into some design concerns after presenting it to our class.  I plan on changing it in different ways and will consult with the rest of the group to see which they like best.

Next week I will:

  * Finalize logo for team
  * Finalize the UI diagrams
  * Help finalize the Test Kit
  * Help test
