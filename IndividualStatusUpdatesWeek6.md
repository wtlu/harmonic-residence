**Shiho Asanuma**

My goals from last week was:
  * Begin coding app, aiming to at least finish the features required for two of the three use cases
  * Learn Facebook API

This week, I began working on learning how to code the Spotify app. I tried implementing tabs, and while I was able to get the tabs to appear, I had trouble figuring out how to change the page content for each tab. I also signed up for the Developer account on Facebook and looked through some of the API.

Next week I will:
  * Figure out how to change page content respective to tabs
  * More HTML/CSS coding

**Alex Fromm**

My goals from last week were:
  * Help with Beta Release
  * Market out Product for testing
  * Create Usability Test Kit
  * Run Usability tests
  * Work with team to formalize User Testing

This week was a bit of a slower week.  We are trying to create a working prototype of our website so, as a designer, I have a little less work to complete.  We as a group also had a lot of work for the week within our other classes so not a lot was completed.  We will have to push the rest of our work out to next week.  I did spend some time working on our usability test script which accounted for my work this week.


Next week I will:
  * Compile User Research Results into a report for team
  * Work with team to finalize results
  * Help with Beta Release
  * Create Usability Test Kit
  * Run Usability tests
  * Work with team to formalize User Testing

My goals from last week were:

  * Search for possible participants for testing

This week was a little slow, but I got into talks with a few people who might be interested in testing.  Other than that, not much else to update.  I unfortunately have not been able to start on the usability test kit.

  * Help with Beta Release
  * Market out Product for testing
  * Create Usability Test Kit
