This week we focused on getting the project started for this quarter by briefly reviewing what we did last quarter and focusing on what we want to accomplish this quarter. After discussing as a team, what we want out of this project, we decided to focus on the implementation of our application. For this project, I handled development last quarter, so I will be continuing to take on a development role. I explored a few APIs, such as Spotify and last.fm, and reviewed some of the APIs that I had found last quarter when doing some individual research for their possibility in providing the music library for our application. I did a competitive analysis of some existing applications. It appears there are applications that are able to play music for groups and make group-based music recommendations. However, I think one of the major differences that will occur in our UI is that we will be creating the application to be used by multiple people on the same computer, rather than remote listening, which the other applications cater toward.

Next week, I will:
  * Explore the APIs I have gained access for in depth for their capabilities and compatibility for our application
  * Provide feedback for the UI diagrams/paper prototype
  * Assist setting up test kit for paper prototype and running tests

This week the team really focused on two main things, setting up our requirements, and figuring out where our project should go in our ten week product cycle.  This week I had the opportunity to work with Julius to outline how our product will complete each of our use cases and also focus on our visual design requirements.  This is where i placed most of my effort, trying to outline what we wanted our design to represent visually.  Through this section I outline some guidelines and goals for our visual design and also selected some font types/sizes for our website.  I also drew a few sketches on how I would like the UI to look like using these goals and guidelines. I would have liked to have worked more closely with the team, specifically with Julius in person to help outline our visual design goals and start work on our UI's.  I learned a bit about setting visual design requirements but i would like to continue to work on them so that we have a more clear cut idea of how our designs will look in the future.

This next week I will be continuing to refine our Visual design goals by meeting with Julius in person so solidify our goals.  After we have completed this we will finish up sketching our UI's and make a paper prototype to test by the end of the week.
As an overview:
  * Finish Visual Design Goals with Julius
  * Sketch UI's to solidify our design ideas
  * Sketch a Paper prototype either with pen or computer aided with Julius
  * Test Paper Prototype and iterate

This week's focus was primarily on what our team would focus on in our research group. Since everyone had different goals, we decided on as a group to mimic a small development team and go through a iterative development flow to create a full-featured Harmonic Residence. Since I already had experience going through these process in my other classes (CSE403 and HCDE455), I put in the template for our initial proposal documents, the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS). I focused mostly on the Process Description document.
Since I'm taking the most credit hours for the research group, I volunteered myself to be the project manager and to make sure everyone is on the same page and focused on the next task. I also researched on different music APIs that we could use, as well as competitors of Harmonic Residence.

Next week I will:
  * Look more at the Spotify API (if granted access), otherwise look at Last.fm or Rdio
  * Start the paper prototype document and assist others in testing with our potential users
  * Look for an alternative way of storing these documents (maybe through Google Code)

The second week allowed us to take some time and really think harder about what direction our project should go.  We spent the week looking at various music APIs and then presented them to one another in a group meeting to see which one we should think about implementing into our web application.  I was able to recommend an API called "Echo Nest", which is a relatively popular API that is used by over 220 music apps including popular ones like iHeartRadio.  Looking at these various APIs really helped me in learning about what each one has to offer and was a great way to see what kind of potential features our application may have down the line.  We decided to narrow down our list and signed up for developer access to each of them, which I have done so.  All but Spotify have granted access so far.

Once we were able to get a better idea of we split into our own individual work for the project plans.  Since Alex and I are working as the designers, we were tasked with elaborating more on the visual design, and thinking of the interfaces for different uses of the product.  I was able to work on the use cases, and have been able to figure out what process we want our users to undergo when completing certain tasks.

Next week I will:
  * Work with Alex to finalize our UI diagrams
  * Get feedback about the UI diagrams
  * Work on the paper prototype (build, share, and test)
