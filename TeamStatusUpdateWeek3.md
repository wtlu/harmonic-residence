## This Week's Progress ##

This week Harmonic Residence had a major setback due to the snow storm. Half the team was trapped in the snow for most of the week and did not get much progress. However, Shiho and Wei-Ting did get approved for the Spotify API, and we decided to go ahead and develop on the Spotify platform. Alex and Julius manage to finish the UI diagrams and managed to get two people to perform the paper prototype testing.
