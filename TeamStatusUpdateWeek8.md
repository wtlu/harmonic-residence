# Team Status Update - Week 8 #

## Last Week's Goals ##

This week Harmonic Residence planned to:
  * Finish Zero Feature Release (All)
  * Start Beta Release (All)
  * Draw up a User Testing Kit (Alex and Julius)

## This Week's Progress ##

This week Harmonic Residence made significant progress compared to past weeks. We presented out ideas to HCDE411 and got good feedback and have since then decided to work on Harmonic Residence for the final project. From feedback from the class, we decided that we need an mobile website that will allow users to sign in and vote for their songs in a more convenient way. We decided to change our product name to Harmonii.us, but the group will remained to be called Harmonic Residence. The team started coding and have finished the Zero-Feature release. We also made a mockup of the mobile site.

## Next Week's Goals ##

Next week Harmonic Residence plans to:
  * Start Beta Release (All)
  * Finish up a User Testing Kit (Alex and Julius)
