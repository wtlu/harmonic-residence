# Team Status Update - Week 2 #
## This Week's Progress ##

This week Harmonic Residence met up for the first time in Winter Quarter to determine the goal of the research project. The team decided to mimic a software development cycle and to create Harmonic Residence. We will be following an iterative development product cycle, where we will first lay out requirements, followed by design, then development and testing cycles. We decided to follow closely to the assignments of CSE403, while incorporating user testing to make it an HCDE research. The group met up and quickly decided on roles. Wei-Ting volunteered himself to be the project manager and a developer. Julius and Alex would primarily be concerned with the UI and visual design. Shiho will primarily be concerned with development, and also assist Julius and Alex when necessary.

This week everyone also did research on the different music APIs that we can use to create Harmonic. We also looked at similar products that are currently on the market. It seems that using Spotify API would be the easiest way to get our product to our users, but we need to wait a few days to get the API key before we can officially decide on an API.

The team as a whole worked every well together this week, and did not encounter much problems. Although we are a little behind because we did not finish UI diagrams, we think it can be finished within the next week, along with paper prototyping testing.

## Next Week's Goals ##

For next week Harmonic Residence will:
  * Finish UI Diagrams (Alex and Julius)
  * Start Paper Prototype Testing (Everyone)
  * Start looking at Spotify API (Shiho and Wei-Ting)
  * Set up development wiki and code repository (Wei-Ting)
