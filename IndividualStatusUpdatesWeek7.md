**Shiho Asanuma**

My goals from last week was:
  * Figure out how to change page content respective to tabs
  * More HTML/CSS coding

I was successful in figuring out how to implement functional tabs on the Spotify app. I also did some research on creating Spotify apps. Since we have not finished figuring out the UI, there hasn't been a lot we can implement.

Next week I will:
  * Coding HTML/CSS for page layout
  * Familiarizing self with using Spotify API more
  * Review jQuery
  * Assist with design to generate more ideas

**Wei-Ting Lu**

My goals from last week were:
  * Work on software architecture document
  * Finish Zero-Feature Release
  * Start coding

This week I was able to finish the software architecture document. Although I wasn't able to finish a sequence diagrams. We found that HCDE411's final project was to work on a visual design of an application and thought it would be a great opportunity to use for Harmonic Residence and decided to pitch the app to the class for us to work on. I made a Powerpoint presentation for the pitch on Tuesday.

Next week I will:
  * Finish Zero-Feature Release
  * Start coding

**Julius Magsino**

My goals from last week were:

  * Help with Beta Release
  * Market out Product for testing
  * Create Usability Test Kit

This week was pretty interesting, as we found out from our 411 (Visual Communication) class that we are able to work as a group on whatever project we wanted.  Conveniently enough, all four of us decided that working on finishing up our Harmonic Residence project for our final would be a great way to apply the visual communication concepts that we learned from class as well as further motivate us to create an much higher fidelity product.  This week we brainstormed on ways that we can use the rest of the quarter efficiently in order to get the project done.

Next week I will:

  * Work on creating higher-fidelity designs
  * Work on the mobile interface
