# Harmonic Residence #
We are Harmonic Residence.

Our project is harmonii.us, which is a music web application that enhances the group music listening experience. Listening to music as a group can be a hassle when members have different tastes in music. The host may be unsure of what kind of music his or her guests like, and even if the host does know their preferences, it may be difficult to find music that everyone will enjoy. Harmonic Residence will solve this problem by allowing all participants to join in a session to stream music that will enjoy.
