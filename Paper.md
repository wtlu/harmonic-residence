# Introduction #

After creating a Paper Prototype Julius and Alex completed one on one testing of the prototype.  After compiling their results the following information was found and added to the next iteration of the design.


## Test Procedures ##

Julius and Alex each ran separate testing in a one on one setting.  Each user was run through three tasks; Task One was to log in using a Spotify username and password, start a music listening Session and add friends, Task Two was to vote for the next song in the list, and the Third Task was to look at the music listening history.  During the test users were asked to "think aloud" and walk the researchers through their thought processes.

## Issues ##
After recording the results there were a few issues that were found:

  * Because the Paper prototype was fairly bare bones the users were confused about what they were initially supposed to do on the log in page.
    * After discussing this issue with the team we realized that this would not be an issue because the user would already be logged in through Spotify.
  * The listen Tree (song history) was a confusing section of testing.  Users were not exactly sure how to interact with the section of the webpage specifically where to click to open the section, how it would react and if you could click on specific songs within the section.
    * To solve this the team decided to add an expand button in the corner of the Listening Tree Section to give users a clear way to interact with the section.  The user also suggested making the section like a timeline where each song could be clicked through like a slideshow.
  * Adding people to a listening section was also confusing, certain users took a little longer to figure out how to add friends.
    * We decided to add a little more information on how to add friends on the home page.

## Results ##

In the end the Paper Prototype was very helpful but we still need to do more testing in the future with a higher fidelity prototype.
