**Shiho Asanuma**

My goals from last week was:
  * Coding HTML/CSS for page layout
  * Familiarizing self with using Spotify API more
  * Review jQuery
  * Assist with design to generate more ideas

This week we got some feedback from in class, and we have come to a decision that the app needs a mobile version to handle multiple participants in the room, so we began ideating layouts for the mobile app. I also implemented the terms of service on to the app and arranged the terms of service and sign in buttons to appear on any page if the user has not logged on.

Next week I will:
  * Help UX design guys with UI mockups
  * Begin converting mockups to HTML/CSS - both desktop and mobile
  * Help revise test kit

**Alex Fromm**

My goals from last week were:
  * Finalize and clean up Desktop Design
  * Create mobile mock-ups/design mobile space
Overflow
  * Create Usability Test Kit
  * Run Usability tests
  * Work with team to formalize User Testing

This was a much faster paced week and as a group, and individually we got a large amount done!  The biggest section of work that was completed was deciding, as a group, to create a mobile application for our product.  We also decided to accompany working on this research group with our 411 class (visual communication) because it would give us more opportunity to work together and in the end create a better product.  Julius and I also sketched up the designs for the mobile application.

Next week I will:
  * Run Usability tests again
  * Compile results into previous report
  * Report to group
Overflow
  * Create Usability Test Kit
  * Run Usability tests
  * Work with team to formalize User Testing

**Julius Magsino**

My goals from last week were:
  * Work on higher-fidelity designs
  * Work on the mobile interface

This week we discussed the idea with our class and instructor, and were able to receive very good feedback on the direction that we should go towards in order to create a positive product with a larger audience.  Everyone seemed to be on board with our application, but emphasized that they wanted some kind of mobile phone aspect to it.

As a result, we are now planning on designing a mobile interface to allow users to vote.  Shiho, Alex, and I worked on creating higher-fidelity models of our application as well as the mobile interface.

Next week I will:
  * Continue working on the designs
  * Help Shiho with the front-end coding for the website
