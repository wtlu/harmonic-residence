**Shiho Asanuma**

My goals from last week was:
  * Continue exploring Spotify API
  * Work on software architecture

We met with Carol from Rhapsody and got some ideas for moving forward with this project. Afterward, we met up to complete the software architecture. I also spent some time learning Mercurial for when we begin coding.

Next week I will:
  * Begin coding app, aiming to at least finish the features required for two of the three use cases
  * Learn Facebook API

**Alex Fromm**

My goals from last week were:
  * Aid in creation of Zero Feature Release
  * Help with release in any way possible
Overflow
  * Finish Paper Prototype Doc - reflection
  * Finalize UI Mockups – Flash Catalyst + Illustrator
  * Name ideas

During the earlier part of the week I unfortunately got a fairly detrimental head cold including a 102 fever and sore throat.  This affected my productivity in the beginning of the week but by Thursday I was feeling well enough to finish up some work.  I spent a good amount of time updated the visual design section of our Project Description and then created a Paper Prototype Results document so we could outline our what we found from our first design testing.  This lead us to some good information but we still need to complete some more testing later in the design process.

Next week I will:
  * Help with Beta Release
  * Market out Product for testing
  * Create Usability Test Kit
  * Find Usability Testing Participants
  * Run Usability tests
  * Work with team to formalize User Testing

This week we met with Carol to talk about Harmonic Residence. We then met up to work on a little bit on the high level software architecture.
I did not get a chance to finish the actual SDS due to time constraints.

Next week I will:
  * Work on software architecture document
  * Finish Zero-Feature Release

**Julius Magsino**

My goals from last week were:
  * Finish Paper Prototype Doc - reflection
  * Finalize UI Mockups – Flash Catalyst + Illustrator
  * Name ideas

I was able to meet Carol with Wei-Ting and Shiho.  Her feedback was extremely beneficial and helped us think about how we should proceed with our application across different areas and topics.

We were able to finish the paper prototype doc.  In addition, very rough UI mockups were finalized using Flash Catalyst and Illustrator.  They are very low fidelity and only emphasize the structure of the site's design and its basic color palette.  Unfortunately, no new names have been able to come to mind, but I will continute on thinking about it.


Next week I will:
  * Search for possible participants for testing
  * Start up usability test kit
