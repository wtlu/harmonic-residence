This week I met with my group to discuss our UI Designs and what they felt would work for our designs and what would not be able to be coded by Wei-Ting and Shiho.  After we discussed what our designs should look like Julius and I met up to choose our colorâ€™s and fix up a few parts of our designs.  After this meeting I spent a solid 5 hours creating the designs into an interactive wire frame using Flash Catalyst.  I then shared this with the group.

My goals from last week were:
  * Work with rest of the team to finish Paper Prototype document.
  * Discuss the next step for paper prototype, as well as review design
  * Start architectural design of Harmonic Residence (both design component and technical component)
  * Continue to look at the Spotify API

This week I met up with the group to talk about the paper prototype results. We also met to design a high level site map and top level pages that we want on HR. I looked at the Spotify API and did their tutorial. I also moved every document we have into the Google Code page. I started the zero-feature release of HR. I did not get a chance to start the software architecture due to time constraints.

Next week I will:
  * Work on software architecture
  * Finish Paper Prototype design document
  * Meet with Carol from Rhapsody
  * Finish Zero-Feature Release

**Julius Magsino**

My goals from last week were:

  * Meet with Alex to finalize the UI design details
  * Help in creating mockups for the design
  * Keep in contact with the development team throughout the design process to check if anything might be out of our scope

This week I was able to meet with the entire group in order to finalize the UI design details.  We were able to go over the paper prototype sessions that Alex and I conducted, and was able to get very good feedback from the team.  Afterwards, we created an IA for the system so that we know exactly how we want to structure the entire site.  Later on I then met with Alex to establish the smaller details of the website, such as color schemes and exactly what kind of layout we want for the website.

Next week I will:
  * Meet with Carol from Rhapsody
  * Take anything that we learn from our meeting and apply it to our design.
