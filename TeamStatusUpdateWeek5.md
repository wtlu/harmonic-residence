## This Week's Progress ##
> This week Harmonic Residence made progress on trying to complete SDS and Zero Feature Release. We met with Carol from Rhapsody to discuss the idea and get feedback. We got great ideas from her and we hope she could our mentor moving forward with our project. We also met and discussed the software architecture we want for Harmonic Residence and drew out some simple class and database diagrams. We also finished the visual design document as well as some visual color design of the application. We also realized we need an actual server to serve content such as listening history to our users, and ask the HCDE department for funding. Unfortunately we didn't get enough time to finish the actual SDS document.

## Next Week's Goals ##

Next week Harmonic Residence plans to:
  * Finish SDS (Shiho and Wei-Ting)
  * Finish Zero Feature Release (All)
  * Start Beta Release (All)
  * Draw up a User Testing Kit (Alex and Julius)
