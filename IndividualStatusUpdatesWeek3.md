**Shiho Asanuma**

My goals from last week was:
  * Explore the APIs I have gained access for in depth for their capabilities and compatibility for our application
  * Provide feedback for the UI diagrams/paper prototype
  * Assist setting up test kit for paper prototype and running tests

I was not able to accomplish everything I wanted to due to the snow and power outage from Thursday to Saturday last week. However, I did get approval for the Spotify API and was able to take a look at the API.

Next week I will:
  * Continue to explore Spotify API
  * Discuss and review UI design with team
  * Create the information architecture for application

**Alex Fromm**

My goal from last week was to continue to refine our Visual design goals by meeting with Julius in person so solidify our goals.  After we have completed this we will finish up sketching our UI's and make a paper prototype to test by the end of the week.
As an overview:
  * Finish Visual Design Goals with Julius
  * Sketch UI's to solidify our design ideas
  * Sketch a Paper prototype either with pen or computer aided with Julius
  * Test Paper Prototype and iterate

This week was a bit off because of the large amount of no school.  I personally slacked off a bit during the beginning of the week because of the snow and the inability to meet with my group members.  Before the snow really hit Julius and myself were able to get together after a class and finish up the UI Guidelines.  After finishing up these we were able to create a paper prototype.  We split up a bit of the work, with myself creating the templates and the images for two of the three use cases.  Julius and I each ran two tests of the paper prototype and compiled what we learned from each on a Google Document.

Next week I will:
  * Meet with Group to finalize UI Design
  * Create Information Architecture
  * Help in Software Architecture creation
  * Create interactive  examples of UI design for developers

**Wei-Ting Lu**

My goals from last week were:
  * Look more at the Spotify API (if granted access), otherwise look at Last.fm or Rdio
  * Start the paper prototype document and assist others in testing with our potential users
  * Look for an alternative way of storing these documents (maybe through Google Code)

This week I continued to look at the Spotify API. I did get approved for the Spotify API, and it's likely that our group will pursue creating our application in Spotify. Since I was snowed in for most of the week, I did not get a chance to meet up with the rest of the team to work on the UI diagrams or get a chance to try testing the paper prototype.

Next week I will:
  * Work with rest of the team to finish Paper Prototype document.
  * Discuss the next step for paper prototype, as well as review design
  * Start architectural design of Harmonic Residence (both design component and technical component)
  * Continue to look at the Spotify API

**Julius Magsino**

My goals from last week were:
  * Work with Alex to finalize our UI diagrams
  * Get feedback about the UI diagrams
  * Work on the paper prototype (build, share, and test)

> This week I was able to work with Alex to draw out the UI diagrams in order to prepare for our paper prototypes. Once we sketched out the diagrams, we used Illustrator to create simple mockups to test out the tasks with a few users.  I was able to test one user, and so far our design is looking good.  I plan to meet with the rest of the group to discuss our findings.

Next Week I will:
  * Meet with Alex to finalize the UI design details
  * Help in creating mockups for the design
  * Keep in contact with the development team throughout the design process to check if anything might be out of our scope
