# Team Status Update - Week 7 #

## Last Week's Goals ##

This week Harmonic Residence planned to:
  * Finish SDS (Shiho and Wei-Ting)
  * Finish Zero Feature Release (All)
  * Start Beta Release (All)
  * Draw up a User Testing Kit (Alex and Julius)

## This Week's Progress ##

This week Harmonic Residence made few progress on coding. We were able to get started on the Spotify App, but not the backend. The SDS was completed. We also found out that we might be able to work on Harmonic Residence as a design project for HCDE411: Visual Communication. We created a pitch deck to convince the class to let us work on the visual design of Harmonic Residence as our final project for that class.

## Next Week's Goals ##

Next week Harmonic Residence plans to:
  * Finish Zero Feature Release (All)
  * Start Beta Release (All)
  * Draw up a User Testing Kit (Alex and Julius)
