# Process Description #

## Tools ##

Harmonic Residence will be split into two main parts. There will be the design and testing of the application, as well as the development of the application itself. We will be using many tools, languages and existing processes to accomplish our software development goals.

The design and testing will primarily be done through Axure and interviews. The application development will be done in HTML5/CSS/Javascript. This will allow the developers to easily create a dynamic web application in a short development time. All members of the team also have experience in all of the tools mentioned before.
We will use Google Code for code repository, website wiki, and bug tracking. Mercurial will be used for version control.

## Group Dynamics ##

| **Wei-Ting Lu**: Project Manager, Development Lead |
|:---------------------------------------------------|
| **Shiho Asanuma**: Developer, UX Lead |
| **Alex Fromm**: UX Designer, User Researcher |
| **Julius Magsino**: UX Designer, User Researcher |

Roles were based on skill-sets. Wei-Ting was chosen from the beginning of project to be Project Manager and Dev Lead because of his experience, and because he is taking the most credit-hours in this project. Shiho wants to explore more of the development side and will assist Wei-Ting, as well as the rest of group. Alex and Julius wanted to explore more of the user experience roles, especially designing user interfaces, and thus their roles were as assigned.

There will need to be a lot of coordination between groups to put this architecture together successfully. Wei-Ting is our project manager and will ensure that each group is kept on track. He will also handle most of the client requests and feedback, which he can translate into action items for the group. We have set up a Dropbox account, which is where all documents are being kept. Weekly client meetings will take place on Tuesdays at 9:00pm. Status reports will be submitted by midnight every Sunday.

## Risk Assessment ##

The following is a list of our top 5 risks, ordered from most important to least impact.

#### Harmonic Residence Does Not Get Approved By Spotify ####

| **Likelihood of occurring** - Medium |
|:-------------------------------------|
| **Impact if it occurs** - High |
| **Evidence** - Terms and Services of Spotify Application |
| **Steps to reduce likelihood** - Making sure our application is not too similar to our competitors |
| **Plan for detection** - Approval process through Spotify |
| **Mitigation Plan** - We can change our application if it does get rejected to suit Spotify. In the worst case scenario, since our application is HTML5/CSS/Javascript, as long as we have a software architecture thatâ€™s decopuled with the API, switching to a different API and releasing the app through a different application may be possible. |

#### Harmonic Residence is Not Finished By End of Quarter ####

| **Likelihood of occuring** - Medium |
|:------------------------------------|
| **Impact if it occurs** - Medium |
| **Evidence** - Every team member has registered for different credit hours. Only 4 team members. |
| **Steps to reduce likelihood** -  No real way other than to manage time better. |
| **Plan for detection** - Communication between team members |
| **Mitigation Plan** - If it turns out the application cannot be done in a reasonable amount of time, features will be cut to bare minimum for release. |

#### Spotify Servers Goes Down ####

| **Likelihood of occuring** - Low |
|:---------------------------------|
| **Impact if it occurs** - High |
| **Evidence** - It happens to all servers at some point, although Spotify has not experienced down time yet. |
| **Steps to reduce likelihood** - Nothing can be done if their servers goes down |
| **Plan for detection** - No real way of detection other than using Spotify and and checking our application |
| **Mitigation Plan** - Nothing can be done if the server does go down. In the worst case scenario, may need to develop and release through a different API |

#### Our Application is just too similar to already existing alternatives to become popular ####
| **Likelihood of occuring** - Medium |
|:------------------------------------|
| **Impact if it occurs** - Medium |
| **Evidence** -  We discovered a few application similar to HR. We spent a long time discussing how we could make our application unique , intuitive, and yet be able to complete our application by the project deadline. |
| **Steps to reduce likelihood** - Highlighting features that are not available through our competitors. Talking with users/customers for new needs as they use our application throughout project. |
| **Plan for detection** - Looking up on Google and searching for similar applications. |
| **Mitigation Plan** - Testing with users and making sure our application have the desired user experience.  |
